# dqn-ashta-chamma
This project was created for CS 260C (grad. deep learning) at UCLA in Spring 2023. This repository contains code for a deep reinforcement learning agent to play Ashta Chamma using experience replay (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chowka_bhara). Ashta Chamma is a board game that I play with my grandmother and a lot of my family members in India :)

Deep Q-networks will be implemented to construct the agent which learns to play the game.
